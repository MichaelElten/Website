      <description>I find that I will often need to add special characters such as “µ” in my figure labels. This is an example of one solution I found to add special characters into them. The solution? Unicode characters.
Unicode is a standardized coding scheme for characters of all languages. As of March 2020, there are close to 150,000 different characters with a corresponding unicode designation. To call a unicode symbol in R, you can simply type the corresponding sequence in a quoted string such as “\u03b1” which will print α.</description>

      <description>This is a post in progress!
Importing the dataFor this, I will use the R package “gtrendsR” for the first time.
library(&amp;quot;dplyr&amp;quot;)library(&amp;quot;readr&amp;quot;)library(&amp;quot;gtrendsR&amp;quot;)library(&amp;quot;googlesheets4&amp;quot;)covid_data %&amp;gt;%filter(provincial_case_id==100) %&amp;gt;%select(province, date_report)## # A tibble: 4 x 2## province date_report## &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt; &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt; ## 1 Ontario 14-03-2020 ## 2 BC 16-03-2020 ## 3 Alberta 18-03-2020 ## 4 Quebec 19-03-2020So Ontario had its 100th case on March 14th, BC on March 16th, Alberta on March 18th and Quebec on March 19th.</description>

      <description>The settingIt was a cold and snowy beginning to Spring here in Ottawa. We had just had one of the most intense and drawn out winters, or at least that is what it felt like to me. To confirm my suspicians, I wanted to take a look back at previous years to see how this past winter ranked.
Luckily for me, there is an excellent publically available data source for historical Canadian weather data, provided by Environment Canada.</description>
