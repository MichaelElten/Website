      <description>I find that I will often need to add special characters such as “µ” in my figure labels. This is an example of one solution I found to add special characters into them. The solution? Unicode characters.
Unicode is a standardized coding scheme for characters of all languages. As of March 2020, there are close to 150,000 different characters with a corresponding unicode designation. To call a unicode symbol in R, you can simply type the corresponding sequence in a quoted string such as “\u03b1” which will print α.</description>
