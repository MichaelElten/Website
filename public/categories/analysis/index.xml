      <description>The settingIt has been about a month since we have really started to feel the impact of Covid-19 in Canada. Outside of the virus itself, the preventive measures (social distancing, closures of schools, etc.), while necessary, have also impacted our daily routines and habits. Google search trends can help provide some insight into how our behaviours are changing, as a google search is often the first step one takes when wanting to purchase an item, learn how to do something, etc.</description>

      <description>The settingIt was a cold and snowy beginning to Spring here in Ottawa. We had just had one of the most intense and drawn out winters, or at least that is what it felt like to me. To confirm my suspicions, I wanted to take a look back at previous years to see how this past winter ranked.
Luckily for me, there is an excellent publicly available data source for historical Canadian weather data, provided by Environment Canada.</description>
