      <description>The settingIt has been about a month since we have really started to feel the impact of Covid-19 in Canada. Outside of the virus itself, the preventive measures (social distancing, closures of schools, etc.), while necessary, have also impacted our daily routines and habits. Google search trends can help provide some insight into how our behaviours are changing, as a google search is often the first step one takes when wanting to purchase an item, learn how to do something, etc.</description>

      <description>I find that I will often need to add special characters such as “µ” in my figure labels. This is an example of one solution I found to add special characters into them. The solution? Unicode characters.
Unicode is a standardized coding scheme for characters of all languages. As of March 2020, there are close to 150,000 different characters with a corresponding unicode designation. To call a unicode symbol in R, you can simply type the corresponding sequence in a quoted string such as “\u03b1” which will print α.</description>
