      <description>You may sometimes want to collect data directly in a Google Sheets form. While you can certainly do so manually in a giant data table, I find having a separate sheet for data entry may be a more elegant solution, and can also protect you from accidentally editing other rows in a data table.
Here I present a quick and easy way to design a data entry form within a Google Sheets workbook, that even works from the mobile app!</description>

      <description>A problem I came across recently was how to make one drop down list based on the contents of another drop down list in order to specify categories and subcategories.
I found two ways of doing this - Method 1 is a simpler technique for when you only need one or two of these in a sheet, and Method 2 is for when you need many of these category-subcategory drop down lists as in a larger table or for data entry.</description>
