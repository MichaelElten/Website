#The setting

I wanted to look at the weather this past winter and compare it to historical data. Luckily for me, there is an excellent publically available data source for historical weather data, provided by [Environment Canada](http://climate.weather.gc.ca/historical_data/search_historic_data_e.html)

#Snowfall

Looking at previous snowfalls now. First you install all packages

```{r installation, echo=TRUE, results='hide', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}


library("tidyverse")
library("ggridges")
library("viridis")
library("lubridate")
library("gganimate")
library("gifski")
```
